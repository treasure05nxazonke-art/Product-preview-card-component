## ✨ What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned how to:

- Use **Flexbox** to create flexible layouts
- Switch layouts between desktop and mobile using **media queries**
- Control spacing effectively with **padding and margin**
- Handle images responsively without breaking layouts
- Understand when fixed heights cause layout issues in responsive design

This project helped me better understand how layout flow changes between screen sizes.

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

One of the main challenges was getting the image and text layout to behave correctly on mobile while keeping the desktop design intact. Fixed heights and image sizing caused overflow and stretching issues.

I solved this by:
- Changing `flex-direction` in media queries
- Removing unnecessary height constraints on mobile
- Letting content size naturally for smaller screens

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Refactor the CSS to be fully **mobile-first**
- Improve accessibility (focus states, semantic elements)
- Further clean up media queries for better scalability
